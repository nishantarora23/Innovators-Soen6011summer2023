## Project Description
### Overview
CareerConnect is a comprehensive web-based career services platform which is aimed to provide user-friendly and centralized tools to both employers and job seekers in the job search process.

### Scope
1. User Profiles : CareerConnect allows the students or other job-seekers to create their job profile that showcase their qualifications, skills, work experience and other interests, enhance it according to the market trends and update their resumes. These profiles serve as a portfolio that enable users to hightlight their expertise to potential employers.

2. Employer Profiles : Employers can leverage this platform to create and post the job opportunities and shortlist the candidates who are the most suitable for their requirements.

3. Ease job-search and application : This platform aims to streamline the job hunting process by providing user-friendly interface for candidates to quickly search, filter and apply for the positions they are most interested in. 

4. Application tracking : CareerConnect aims to simply the application tracking process. Once a candidate applies for the job, the hiring manager gets notified and is able to view the profile of the job-applicant. The system also notifies the selected candidates who are further called for an interview.

### Resources required
- Development team with expertise in web application development, user experience design, and database management.
- Tools and technologies to create the platform.
- Servers and infrastructure to host the platform.

- **Front-End Development: React**
<br>The user interface of the application will be developed using the React JavaScript library. React provides a component-based architecture that enables modular and reusable code, resulting in a more efficient development process. Its virtual DOM rendering and state management capabilities enhance the performance and responsiveness of the application, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Back-End Development: Java Servlets**
<br>The back-end of the application will be implemented using Java Servlets. Servlets provide a robust and scalable framework for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs. With its extensive Java ecosystem and support for enterprise-grade development, Servlets allow for seamless integration with various libraries, frameworks, and databases.

- **Database Management System: MySQL**
<br>For data storage and management, the project will utilize the MySQL relational database management system. MySQL is widely recognized for its performance, scalability, and reliability. Its support for SQL queries and ACID-compliant transactions ensures efficient data manipulation and retrieval, making it suitable for handling the project's data storage requirements.

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment: Jenkins with Gradle**
<br>To facilitate continuous integration and deployment, we will employ Jenkins, an open-source automation server. Jenkins, integrated with Gradle, will automate the building, testing, and deployment processes. This will ensure the project's codebase remains stable and reliable, enabling rapid iterations and reducing the risk of deployment errors.

- **Source Control and Project Management: GitHub**
<br>GitHub will serve as the primary source control management (SCM) tool for the project, providing version control and collaboration features. It will also act as a ticketing tool, allowing for issue tracking, task assignment, and progress monitoring. The project's repository on GitHub will provide transparency and facilitate effective project management, ensuring seamless collaboration among team members.
