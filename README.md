## Project Description
### Overview
--------------
CareerConnect is a comprehensive web-based career services platform which is aimed to provide user-friendly and centralized tools to both employers and job seekers in the job search process.

### Scope
--------------
1. User Profiles : CareerConnect allows the students or other job-seekers to create their job profile that showcase their qualifications, skills, work experience and other interests, enhance it according to the market trends and update their resumes. These profiles serve as a portfolio that enable users to hightlight their expertise to potential employers.

2. Employer Profiles : Employers can leverage this platform to create and post the job opportunities and shortlist the candidates who are the most suitable for their requirements.

3. Ease job-search and application : This platform aims to streamline the job hunting process by providing user-friendly interface for candidates to quickly search, filter and apply for the positions they are most interested in. 

4. Application tracking : CareerConnect aims to simply the application tracking process. Once a candidate applies for the job, the hiring manager gets notified and is able to view the profile of the job-applicant. The system also notifies the selected candidates who are further called for an interview.

### Resources required
-------------------
- Development team with expertise in web application development, user experience design, and database management.
